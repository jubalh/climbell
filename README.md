# climbell

climbell is a commandline application for language learning.

It uses the old [Glossika](https://glossika.com/) courses.
If you own these courses, which ship sentences in PDF and audio format, you can use [GlossikaNativeGLS](https://github.com/chickendude/GlossikaNativeGLS) to transform the content into `.gls` files.

These files are readable by the Android app [Natibo](https://github.com/chickendude/Natibo) and climbell.
